\noindent {\large \textbf{Dynamic Markov Chain}}

\bigskip

See  4.7, 5.5.4 and 6.4 in \textsl{Journal of Generative Sonic Art} \citep{yi}. In short, what I call a `Dynamic Markov Chain' allows increasing or coercion decreasing the order in a manner that the transition probabilities do not reach 100\% for a single event.
